## This is a little frontend project for my own website, HTML, CSS and JS are used.
#####   For main branch, I followed the Youtube video to set up my website step by step. But I don not know why the outcome was a little different with the video's, so for some parts, I used my own way to achieve the results.And I sum up somes keys  should pay more attention when developing web.
        - the class or ID name, Mike, mike, mikes are different
        - Don not forget "." in CSS for class
        - In .js document, "mike", and mike is different, so remember "".
